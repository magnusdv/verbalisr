# verbalisr 0.5.0

This is a maintenance release with only minor changes.

* In README, link to BMC Bioinformatics paper about QuickPed, which describes the **verbalisr** algorithm.

* Tweak the description of double asymmetric relationships.


# verbalisr 0.4.0

* This version requires **pedtools 1.1.0** and **ribd 1.3.1**.

* The paths are now sorted more sensibly than before.

* New dataset `habsburg` showing the royal Habsburg family.

* The `format()` gains logical parameters `cap` (first letter capitalisation) and `includePaths`, both defaulting to TRUE.

* The `verbose` argument of `verbalise()` should never have been there, and has been dropped.


# verbalisr 0.3.0

* Add separate `print()` and `format()` methods.

* The main code of `verbalise()` has been overhauled.


# verbalisr 0.2.1

* Initial CRAN version
